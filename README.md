## Introduction

Instacart has published a [dataset](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) for about 3 million orders. The aim in this project is to calculate the number of time a product was requested for each department and find the number of times a product was requested on the first order as we as the ratio of the two findings.

## Input Datasets

For this challenge, we have two separate input data sources, `order_products.csv` and `products.csv`.

You can assume each line of the file `order_products.csv` holds data on one request. The file contains data of the form

```
order_id,product_id,add_to_cart_order,reordered
2,33120,1,1
2,28985,2,1
2,9327,3,0
2,45918,4,1
3,17668,1,1
3,46667,2,1
3,17461,4,1
3,32665,3,1
4,46842,1,0
```

where

* `order_id`: unique identifier of order
* `product_id`: unique identifier of product
* `add_to_cart_order`: sequence order in which each product was added to shopping cart
* `reordered`: flag indicating if the product has been ordered by this user at some point in the past. The field is `1` if the user has ordered it in the past and `0` if the user has not. While data engineers should validate their data, for the purposes of this challenge, you can take the `reordered` flag at face value and assume it accurately reflects whether the product has been ordered by the user before.

The file `products.csv` holds data on every product, and looks something like this:

```
product_id,product_name,aisle_id,department_id
9327,Garlic Powder,104,13
17461,Air Chilled Organic Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts,35,12
17668,Unsweetened Chocolate Almond Breeze Almond Milk,91,16
28985,Michigan Organic Kale,83,4
32665,Organic Ezekiel 49 Bread Cinnamon Raisin,112,3
33120,Organic Egg Whites,86,16
45918,Coconut Butter,19,13
46667,Organic Ginger Root,83,4
46842,Plain Pre-Sliced Bagels,93,3
```
where

* `product_id`: unique identifier of the product
* `product_name`: name of the product
* `aisle_id`: identifier of aisle in which product is located
* `department_id`: identifier of department

## Running the code
* The code is written in Python with a name “purchase_anaytics.py “
* Per repo structure the code is located in src directory
* The following syntax should be used in order to the run the shell script 'run.sch'
  ./run.sch
* The code needs to csv files (datasets) as an input, namely 'order_products.csv' and 'products.csv'
* The directory structure of the repo look like this:
